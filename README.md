This repository contains my coursework, homework submissions, and projects for STAT 641: Bootstrapping and Resampling Methods, part of my Master of Science in Data Science at California State University, East Bay.
The course focuses on modern computational statistics, including:
Nonparametric bootstrap
Parametric bootstrap
Jackknife and jackknife-after-bootstrap
Monte Carlo simulation
Bootstrap confidence intervals (percentile, BCa, studentized)
Resampling-based hypothesis testing
Applications of bootstrapping to regression and generalized models
